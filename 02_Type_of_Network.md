# Chapter 2: Types of Networks

## 2.1 Local Area Network (LAN)
- **Definition**: A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building.
- **Characteristics**: Typically has high data transfer rates, low latency, and is usually owned, controlled, and managed by a single person or organization.
- **Examples**: Office buildings often use LANs to connect employees' computers to printers, servers, and other shared resources.

## 2.2 Wide Area Network (WAN)
- **Definition**: A Wide Area Network (WAN) extends over a large geographic area and is used to connect different LANs together. This can involve connections between cities, regions, or countries.
- **Characteristics**: Generally slower speeds than LANs due to the vast distances data must travel and the complex technologies involved.
- **Examples**: The Internet is the largest example of a WAN, connecting millions of networks worldwide.

## 2.3 Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi)
- **Definition**: Wi-Fi networks are a type of wireless LAN (WLAN) that use radio waves to connect computers and other devices to the internet and each other.
- **Characteristics**: Offers the convenience of robust network connections without the need for physical cables.
- **Security Considerations**: Security is paramount, with protocols like WPA2 used to encrypt and secure network traffic.

## 2.4 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- **Definition**: A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically used to connect users within an area as large as a city.
- **Characteristics**: MANs are often used to connect several LANs together, or provide connectivity for corporations and governments within a city.
- **Uses**: Universities or local governments use MANs to connect to various campuses or administrative buildings across a city.

## 2.5 Personal Area Network (PAN)
- **Definition**: A Personal Area Network (PAN) is designed for personal devices within a very small area, typically within a few meters of a person.
- **Characteristics**: Usually for individual use, PANs connect devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets.
- **Examples**: Bluetooth and USB are common technologies that enable PANs, connecting devices like headsets, mice, and keyboards to computers or phones.

## 2.6 Storage Area Network (SAN)
- **Definition**: A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a specialized network designed to provide access to consolidated, block-level data storage.
- **Characteristics**: SANs are primarily used to make storage devices accessible to servers so that the devices appear as locally attached to the operating system.
- **Uses**: SANs are critical in enterprise storage environments, facilitating high-speed data transfer and redundancy.

## 2.7 Conclusion
- **Summary of the Chapter**: This chapter provided an overview of the different types of networks including LAN, WAN, Wi-Fi, MAN, PAN, and SAN, each serving distinct purposes and uses.
- **Whatâ€™s Next**: Next, we will explore network topologies, which describe the layout and arrangement of network components, further deepening our understanding of how networks are structured.
